<h1> Computing Biography </h1>
<h2 class="green"> How it started </h2>

<p id=redtxt>
  Before taking any classes this semester I've never had any experience in
  computer science. I enrolled in this class because I believe that it would be
  good to know in the long run and also it seemed like a very interesting subject,
  which is why after a couple weeks in CINS and CSCI I decided to declare a major
  in computer science. Before taking these classes I wasn't really motivated
  in school because the topics I was studying would bore me, but now I try to not
  even skip a single day because the material to learn in these classes really
  interest me.
