  <p id="redtxt">
    I grew up in the southern part of California and decided to attend <span>Chico
     state</span> for college because I really enjoyed the campus.
      I am currently a junior pursuing a major in computer science.I don't plan
      on graduating for another 1-2 years because this year I barely decided to
      declare a major in computer science. I chose this route because I noticed
      that although it may be difficult it was what I found interest in.
